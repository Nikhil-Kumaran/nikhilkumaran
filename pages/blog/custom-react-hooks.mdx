## Hooks

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

React has various build-in hooks,

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useReducer
- useCallback
- useMemo
- useRef
- useImperativeHandle
- useLayoutEffect
- useDebugValue

## Custom Hooks

When we want to share stateful logic among react components, we can go for custom hooks. A custom Hook is just a JavaScript function whose name starts with `use` and that may call other react Hooks.

Let's create a `useClipboard` hook which copies a given text to the clipboard. We'll use the [Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API) to achieve this.

Unfortunately, Firefox doesn't fully support **Clipboard API** so make sure you use Chrome or Safari.

When you click on `copy` button, the code will be copied to your clipboard and you can paste it anywhere. Note that when you try to click the `copy` button within the `codesandbox` you will get permission denied, so open the output link in the new tab and interact with it.

Let's first look at the `Clipboard.js` file. Clipboard API does asynchronous read from and write to the system clipboard. So I'm setting `isCopied` state to `true` when our text is copied successfully and setting it to `false` when there is an error.

`setClipboard` is where we define the logic for copying to clipboard. First I'm checking if I have `clipboard-write` permission. If the permission is granted or if it is prompted to the user, we can use `navigator.clipboard.writeText` to set our text to the system clipboard. I'm returning `[isCopied, setClipboard]` similar to how useState returns two variables. You can return any number of values though.

Next, I'm using useEffect to reset the `isCopied` state after a specified time interval. Finally exporting our `useClipboard` hook.

Now let's look at how we use our custom hook. In the `App.js` file, I'm importing our `useClipboard` hook and calling it with a time interval. As we defined, it will return `isCopied` bool and `setClipboard` function which we can use to set our text to the clipboard.

I have a `code` tag with `console.log('Hello world')` text and a button `copy` which when clicked will copy the content of the `code` to our system clipboard. When the text is copied I'm changing the button label to `copied` based on the `isCopied` state and resetting back to `copy` after our specified interval.
Great. Now we implemented our own custom hook which we can share among our components.

That's it, folks, thanks for reading this blog post. Hope it's been useful for you.
